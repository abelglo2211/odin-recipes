     <!-- recipe ingredients  -->
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package little smokie sausages</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, or to taste</li>
     </ul>
     <!-- recipe instructions  -->
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut bacon slices into thirds and wrap each strip around a sausage. Secure the wrapped sausages on wooden skewers, several to a skewer. Arrange the skewers on a baking sheet and sprinkle them liberally with brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and sugar has melted into a glaze, 20 to 25 minutes, turning halfway through for even caramelization.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving platter and let stand 5 minutes before serving; the glaze will thicken as it cools. Serve and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
